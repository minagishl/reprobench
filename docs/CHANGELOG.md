## [0.1.0] - 2026-05-04

- `.github/workflows/benchmark.yml` — Benchmark workflow running `reprobench run`, `guard`, and `report` via Nix dev shell on every PR and push
- `.gitignore` — Excludes `node_modules/`, `dist/`, `bench/results/`, and generated example files
- `package.json` `files` field — Limits npm publish to `dist/`, `LICENSE`, and `README.md` only
- `.oxlintrc.json` for oxlint configuration
- `.oxfmtrc.json` — oxfmt configuration with `semi: true` and `singleQuote: false`
- `.editorconfig` — Consistent editor settings across all file types
- `docs/CHANGELOG.md` — This changelog following the Keep a Changelog 1.1.0 format
- Example files under `examples/simple/` for quick start and testing
- 14 unit tests covering compare, report, and guard logic

### Fixed

- `benchmark.yml` — incorrect path resolution caused by combining `working-directory: examples/simple` with `node dist/cli.js`; replaced with `bash -c "cd examples/simple && node ../../dist/cli.js ..."`
- `flake.nix` — replaced removed `nodePackages.pnpm` with `pnpm` (top-level package) following nixpkgs upstream change
- `.gitignore` — added `!examples/**/reprobench.config.json` to prevent example config from being excluded, which caused CI to fail with "Config file not found"
- `release.yml` — switched publish step from `pnpm publish` to `npm publish` since pnpm does not support npm Trusted Publishing OIDC token exchange

### Changed

- `release.yml` — switched publish step to `npx --yes npm@latest publish` to avoid `npm install -g npm@latest` circular install failure
